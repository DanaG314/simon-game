# Simon

## Description

Simon is a short-term memory game where the player must repeat an increasing sequence of lights and sounds. The game begins with Simon playing his sequence, and the player mimics the sequence in order to make it to the next round. Each round Simon adds another step to the sequence making it harder to remember. The game ends when a player enters an incorrect sequence.
